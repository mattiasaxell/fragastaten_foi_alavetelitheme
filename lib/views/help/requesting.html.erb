<dd>
<p>It can be hard to untangle government's complicated structured, and work out
who knows the information that you want. Here are a few tips:
<ul>
<li>Browse or search <%= site_name %> looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
<li>When you've found an authority you think might have the information, use
the "home page" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they do
on their website.</li>
<li>Contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
information you're after.</li>
<li>Don't worry excessively about getting the right authority. If you get it
wrong, they ought to advise you who to make the request to instead.
</li>
<li>If you've got a thorny case, please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> for help.</li>
</ul>

<dt id="missing_body">You're missing the public authority that I want to request from! <a href="#missing_body">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>Please <a href="<%= new_change_request_path %>">contact us</a> with the name of the public authority and,
if you can find it, their contact email address for Freedom of Information requests.
</p>
<p>If you'd like to help add a whole category of public authority to the site, we'd love
to hear from you too.

<dt id="authorities">Why do you include some authorities that aren't formally subject to Freedom of Information through Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen)?<a href="#authorities">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p><%= site_name %> lets you make requests for information to a range of
organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Those formally subject to the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen)</li>
  <li> Those formally subject to the Environmental Regulations (a less well
  defined group)</li>
  <li> Those which voluntarily comply with the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen)</li>
  <li> Those which aren't subject to the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen) but we think should be, on grounds
  such as them having significant public responsibilities and receive large amounts of public grants financed by taxes.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the last case, we're using the site to lobby for expansion of the
scope of the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen). Even if an organisation is not legally obliged to respond
to a request of public document, they can still do so voluntarily.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="focused">Why must I keep my request focused?<a href="#focused">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
<i>not</i> include any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arguments about your cause</li>
<li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
<li>questions or requests about comments or opinion rather than about specific information</a>
</ul>

<p>
If you include strange material, as examples mentioned above, we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with
libel law, which is a pain for both you and us. Short, succinct messages
make it easier for authorities to be clear what information you are
requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.
</p>

<p>
The site is only for hosting Freedom of Information (FOI) requests,
to show the value of Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen),
not for general correspondence with public authorities.
Phrasing your request as a question or a request
for comment (e.g. &ldquo;why are you doing X?&rdquo; or &ldquo;please
explain why you are doing X&rdquo;) makes it more likely that your message
will not be seen as a valid FOI request, both by us and by the public
authority. Asking for &ldquo;copies of all policies and procedures
regarding X&rdquo; would normally result in a valid FOI request.
</p>

<p>
If you want information to support an argument or campaign, Freedom of
Information is a powerful tool. Although you may not use this site to
run your campaign, we encourage you to use it to get the information you
need. We also encourage to run your campaign elsewhere - one effective
and very easy way is to <%= link_to 'start your own blog',
"http://wordpress.com/"%>. You are welcome to link to your campaign
from this site in an annotation to your request (you can make
annotations after submitting the request).
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request?<a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>Making an Freedom of Information request using the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen) is nearly always free of charge
- often depending on if the authority chooses digital first or not.</p>

<p>Authorities often include unnecessary, scary, boilerplate in
acknowledgement messages saying they &ldquo;may&ldquo; charge a fee. Ignore such notices.
They hardly ever will actually charge a fee. If they do, they can only charge you if
you have specifically agreed in advance to pay.
</p>

<p>Sometimes an authority will refuse your request, saying that the cost
of handling it exceeds a certain amount of Swedish Kronor (for central government) or other amount of Swedish Kronor (for all other
public authorities). At this point you can refine your
request. e.g. it would be much cheaper for an authority to tell you the amount
spent on marshmallows in the past year than in the past ten years.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="format">Will I get the information in the format that I request? <a href="#format">#</a> </dt>
<dd>
<p>
The law requires that if you ask for information to be provided in a
specific format, then the public authority is obliged to give
information released in the requested format as long as it is reasonably
practical to do this. You are not entitled to obtain documents
digital via e.g. e-mail which is why the legislation has fallen behind.
Unfortunately, public officials currently interpret this requirement
to refer only to the choice of receiving documents in paper or
receive them electronically and not a choice of electronic file formats or for delivery channel.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>By law, public authorities must respond <strong>promptly</strong> to
requests.
</p>

<p>Even if they are not prompt, in nearly all cases they must respond within
1 working day. If you had to clarify your request, or they are a school,
or one or two other cases, then they may have more time
(<a href="/help/officers#days">full details</a>).

<p><%= site_name %> will email you if you don't get a timely response. You can
then send the public authority a message to remind them, and tell them if they
are breaking the law.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response?<a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
    received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
    checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
    </li>
    <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
    "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer
    '<a href="/help/officers#spam_problems">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!</a>'
    in the FOI officers section of this help.
    </li>
    <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
    and then complain to the Information Commissioner about the authority.
    Read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt id="not_satifised">What if I'm not satisfied with the response? <a href="#not_satifised">#</a> </dt>
<dd>If you didn't get the information you asked for, or you didn't get it in time,
then read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.
</dd>

<dt id="reuse">It says I can't re-use the information I got!<a href="#reuse">#</a> </dt>
<dd>
<p>Authorities sometimes add a legal boilerplate about reusing data in public documents. Read more at the E-Delegation's website
"<a href="http://www.vidareutnyttjande.se/">Vidareutnyttjande.se</a>", a guide that helps you with what you can do with the public information.
</p>

<p>You can, of course, write articles about the information or summarise it, or
quote parts of it. We also think you should feel free to republish the
information in full if it does not harm personal integrity of private individuals, just as we do, even though in theory you might not be
allowed to do so. See <a href="/help/officers#copyright">our policy on copyright</a>.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="data_protection">Can I request information about myself or about another private individual? <a href="#data_protection">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>No. Requests made using Fr√•gaStaten are public, made under the Principle of Public Access (Offentlighetsprincipen),
and the platform is not designed to help you find sensitive information about a private individual.
Public bodies should not disclose public documents electronically if they contain sensitive personal details.
They are reminded about this in requests done via the platform.</p>

<p>If you would like to know what information a public
authority holds about yourself, you should make a "Subject Access Request" throguh
private using Data Protection law. The website of the
<a href="http://www.datainspektionen.se/lagar-och-regler/personuppgiftslagen/dina-rattigheter/">
Data Protection Agency</a> gives advice on how you get access to your own private information.</p>

<p>If you see that somebody has included personal information, perhaps
unwittingly, in a request, please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>
immediately so we can remove it.</p>
</dd>


<dt id="private_requests">I'd like to keep my request secret! (At least until I publish my story) <a href="#private_requests">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p><%= site_name %> is currently only designed for public requests. All
responses that we receive are automatically published on the website for anyone
to read.</p>

<p>You should contact the public authority directly if you would like to
make a request in private.  If you're interested in getting help to set up a system which helps
you manage FOI requests in secret, then <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="multiple">Can I make the same to request to lots of authorities, e.g. all councils? <a href="#multiple">#</a> </dt>

<dd>Yes, under certain circumstances, which also means a larger responsibility in your use.
We ask you to first send a test version of your request to a few
authorities. Their responses will help you improve the wording of your request,
so that you get the best information when you send the request to all of
the authorities. There is currently no automated system for sending the request
to the other authorities, you must copy and paste it by hand.

</dd>

<dt id="offsite">I made a request off the site, how do I upload it to the archive?<a href="#offsite">#</a> </dt>

<dd><%= site_name %> is an archive of requests only made through the site,
and does not try to be an archive of all Freedom of Information requests. We'll never support uploading
other requests. For one thing, we wouldn't be able to verify that other
responses actually came from the authority. If this really matters to you,
you can always make the same request again via <%= site_name %>.
</dd>

<dt id="moderation">How do you moderate request annotations? <a href="#moderation">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>Annotations on <%= site_name %> are to help
people get the information they want, or to give them pointers to places they
can go to help them act on it. We reserve the right to remove anything else
and turn off annotations on specific requests.
</p>
<p>Endless, political discussions are not allowed.
