  <dt id="purpose">What is FrågaStaten for? <a href="#purpose">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  To help you find out inside information about the Swedish Government and Swedish public bodies.
  The site helps people access information about central government, local government,
  Riksdag (Parliament), health services, the armed forces, state funded schools and universities and
  other public authorities.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can also use the site to find out information that regulators hold about businesses,
  charities and other organisations.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
  write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
  to the public authority. Any response received is automatically published on the
  website for you and anyone else to find and read.
  </dd>

  <dt id="whybother_me">Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
  things that affect your life, from health care through to national defence. Some
  it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
  works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
  are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.
  Some people also use the site for research.
  </dd>

  <dt id="whybother_them">Why would the public authority bother to reply? <a href="#whybother_them">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>Under the constitutional law Freedom of Press and the Principle of Public Access (Freedom of Information, FOI in short), they have to respond. The response
  will either contain the information you want, or give a valid legal reason why
  it has not been provided.
  </dd>

  <dt id="useful">Does useful information get released through the site? <a href="#useful">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>
  Yes. Thousands of documents have been released through similar services around the world.
