  <dt id="top">I just got here from bottom of an FOI request, what is going on? <a href="#top">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>FrågaStaten is a service run by a charity. It helps ordinary members
  of the public make FOI requests, and easily track and share the responses.</p>

  <p>The FOI request you received was made by someone using FrågaStaten. You can
  simply reply to the request as you would any other request from an individual.
  The only difference is that your response will be automatically published on
  the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>If you have privacy or other concerns, please read the answers below.
  You might also like to read the <a
  href="/help/about">introduction to FrågaStaten</a> to find out more about what
  the site does from the point of view of a user. You can also search the
  site to find the authority that you work for, and view the status of
  any requests made using the site.

  <p>Finally, we welcome comments and
  thoughts from FOI officers, please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">get in touch</a>.

  <dt id="responses">Why are you publishing responses to FOI requests? <a href="#responses">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>We think there are lots of benefits. Most importantly it will encourage the
  public to be more interested and involved in the work of government. We
  also hope that it will reduce the number of duplicate requests on any
  subject that a public body will receive. Given that Freedom of Information
  responses contain public information, which anybody could easily request
  again from the public authority, we think there should be no reason not to
  publish it widely as long as there are no personal and sensitive data on citizens in it.
  </dd>

  <dt id="realpeople">Are the people making requests real people? <a href="#realpeople">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>Yes. For the purposes of keeping track of responses we use
  computer-generated email addresses for each request. However, before
  they can send a request, each user must register on the site with a
  unique email address that we then verify. You can search this site and
  find a page listing all requests that each person has made.
  </dd>

  <dt id="email_only">An email isn't a sufficient address for an FOI request! <a href="#email_only">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>
  Yes, it is. According to the E-delegation's <a href="http://www.vidareutnyttjande.se/juridik-och-rekommendationer/regelverket/regler-om-att-lamna-ut-information-2-kap-tf-m-m/">rules about disclosing information</a> an email message is a sufficient medium.
  However, authorities have no formal obligation to disclose documents electronically - especially if
  <a href="http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/93d404b4554140cab61cd59d55712715/allmanna-handlingar-i-elektronisk-form---offentlighet-och-integritet-sou-20104">documents contain sensitive personal information</a>.
  Although according to the Swedish Data Protection Authority, many agencies are already out public documents in electronic format as far as it does not contain sensitive personal data because of its many advantages.
  This is how they write in the report <a href="https://www.datainspektionen.se/Documents/remissvar/2010-06-23-e-offentlighet.pdf">"Official documents in electronic form - publicity and privacy (SOU 2010: 4)"</a>:
  "To a large extent the authorities also provide public documents in electronic form when it does not involve any privacy risks."
  This goes hand-in-hand with the philosophy that the FrågaStaten project sympathize with. The <a href="http://se.okfn.org/get-involved/projects">project</a> is about democratic transparency, to pay attention, educate and strengthen open government and open innovation.
  The project is not about seeking out and publishing individuals' personal data, but about increasing transparency in the public sector for the strengthening of democracy in Sweden.

  <dt id="vexatious">Aren't you making lots of vexatious requests? <a href="#vexatious">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>FrågaStaten is not making any requests. We are sending requests on
  behalf of our users, who are real people making the requests. </p>
  <p>Look at it like this - if lots of different people made requests from
  different Hotmail email addresses, then you would not think that Microsoft were
  making vexatious requests. It is exactly the same if lots of requests are made
  via FrågaStaten. Moreover, since all requests are public it is much easier
  for you to see if one of our users is making vexatious requests. </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="spam_problems">I can see a request on FrågaStaten, but we never got it by email!<a href="#spam_problems">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>If a request appears on the site, then we have attempted to send it to
  the authority by email. Any delivery failure messages will automatically
  appear on the site. You can check the address we're using with the "View FOI
  email address" link which appears on the page for the authority. <a
  href="/help/contact">Contact us</a> if there is a better address we can
  use.</p>
  <p>Requests are sometimes not delivered because they are quietly removed by
  "spam filters" in the IT department of the authority. Authorities can make
  sure this doesn't happen by asking their IT departments to "whitelist"
  any email from <strong>@fragastaten.se</strong>.
  If you <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">ask us</a> we will resend any request,
  and/or give technical details of delivery so an IT department can chase
  up what happened to the message.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, you can respond to any request from your web browser, without
  needing any email, using the "respond to request" link at the bottom of
  each request page.

  <dt id="days">How do you calculate the deadline shown on request pages?<a href="#days">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>
  <p>The Freedom of Press Act says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A request about a copy of a public document must be processed with <strong>quickl</strong> according to
      <a href="http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Tryckfrihetsforordning-19491_sfs-1949-105/#K2">Tryckfrihetsförordningen Kapitel 2, 13 §</a>.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The nerdy detail of exactly how weekends are counted, and what happens if
  the request arrives out of office hours, is just that - detail. What matters
  here is that the law says authorities must respond <strong>promptly</strong>.</p>

  <p>If you've got a good reason why the request is going to take a while to
  process, requesters find it really helpful if you can send a quick email with a
  sentence or two saying what is happening. </p>

  <p>FOI officers often have to do a lot of <strong>hard work</strong> to answer
  requests, and this is hidden from the public. We think it would help everyone
  to have more of that complexity visible.</p>

  </dd>

  <dt id="days2">But really, how do you calculate the deadline?<a href="#days2">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>

  <p>Please read the answer to the previous question first. Legally, authorities
  must respond <strong>quickly</strong> to FOI requests. If they fail to do that,
  it is best if they show the hard work they are doing by explaining what is
  taking the extra time to do.
  </p>

  <p>With that said, FrågaStaten cannot show a maximum legal deadline
  for response on each request thus we set a deadline that seemed reasonable when researching this topic.
  More detailed information about this can be found at <a href="http://www.allmanhandling.se/?p=3036">AllmanHandling.se</a>.</p>
  In short, FrågaStaten shows an approximated maximum time limit to answer to each request that can seem reasonable for "quickly" processed handling.
  It is described below how we calculate it.
  <ul>

  <li>If the day we deliver the request by email is a working day, we count that
  as "day zero", even if it was delivered late in the evening. Days end at
  midnight.  We then count the next working day as "day one", and so on up to
  <strong>20 working days</strong>.</li>

  <li>If the day the request email was delivered was a non-working day, we count
  the next working day as "day one". Delivery is delivery, even if it happened on
  the weekend. </li>

  <li>Requesters are encouraged to mark when they have <strong>clarified</strong>
  their request so the clock resets, but sometimes they get this wrong. If you
  see a problem with a particular request, let us know and we'll fix it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The date thus calculated is shown on requests with the text "By law,
  Regeringskansliet should normally have responded by...". There is only
  one case which is not normal, see the next question about
  <a href="#public_interest_test">public interest test time extensions</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're getting really nerdy about all this, read the complete collection of perspectives at <a href="">AllmanHandling.se</a>.
  Meanwhile, remember that the law says authorities must respond
  <strong>promptly</strong>. That's really what matters.</p>

  <dt id="large_file">How can I send a large file, which won't go by email?<a href="#large_file">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>Instead of email, you can respond to a request directly from your web
  browser, including uploading a file. To do this, choose "respond to request" at
  the bottom of the request's page. <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Contact us</a> if it
  is too big for even that (more than, say, 50Mb).
  </dd>

  <dt id="names">Why do you publish the names of public servants and the text of emails? <a href="#names">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>We consider what officers or servants do in the course of their employment
  to be public information. We will only remove content in exceptional
  circumstances, see our <a href="<%= help_privacy_path(:anchor => 'takedown') %>">take down policy</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="mobiles">Do you publish email addresses or mobile phone numbers? <a href="#mobiles">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>To prevent spam, we automatically remove most emails and some mobile numbers from
  responses to requests. Please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> if we've
  missed one.
  For technical reasons we don't always remove them from attachments, such as certain PDFs.</p>
  <p>If you need to know what an address was that we've removed, please <a href="/help/contact">get in touch with us</a>. Occasionally, an email address
  forms an important part of a response and we will post it up in an obscured
  form in an annotation.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="copyright"><a name="commercial"></a>What is your policy on copyright of documents?<a href="#copyright">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>Our Freedom of Information law is "applicant blind", so anyone in the
  world can request the same document and get a copy of it with the right to be anonymous.

  If you think our making a document available on the internet infringes your
  copyright, you may <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> and ask us
  to take it down.  However, to save tax payers' money by preventing duplicate
  requests, and for good public relations, we'd advise you not to do that.
